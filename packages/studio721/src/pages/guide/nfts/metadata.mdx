The term `metadata` refers to "auxiliary data" that describes some "main data".
It's a vague term that developers use for a lot of different things, but it
means something specific when talking about NFTs.

## NFT Metadata

In the case of an NFT, let's say a photograph NFT, the "main data" is the image
file. This is likely a binary file format, such as PNG, and is typically stored
on some cloud/decentralized server. The `metadata` is then the "auxiliary data"
_about_ the photograph: its title, description, traits, and most importantly,
the link to the PNG file wherever it may be stored.

The metadata is stored in a JSON format, such as this:

<Editor
  height={220}
  filename="0.json"
  code={`{
  "name": "Token #0",
  "description": "An example nonfungible token. Photo by Austin Schmid from https://picsum.photos.",
  "image": "https://picsum.photos/id/909/510/510",
  "attributes": [
    { "trait_type": "Width", "value": 3200 },
    { "trait_type": "Height", "value": 1800 },
  ]
}`}
/>

There are several different supported metadata schemas. The one shown above
follows one of the formats outlined in the
[OpenSea Metadata Standards](https://docs.opensea.io/docs/metadata-standards).

## Token URI

Remember the smart contract function `tokenURI` from the previous section? The
`tokenURI` function returns the uri of a metadata JSON file like the one shown
above! This is how wallets, marketplaces, and other smart contracts know where
to find the image for the NFT: they first call the `tokenURI` function to read
the metadata JSON file, and then they display the link from the `image` field of
the JSON.

For an ERC-721 collection of 10000 NFTs, each token will typically have its own
metadata JSON file â€” this means 10000 separate JSON files. Where do all of these
get stored?

## Metadata Storage

There are typically 3 places where metadata files are stored:

- **"On-chain"** - Directly on the blockchain as part of a smart contract
- **IPFS** - An immutable, decentralized file storage solution, https://ipfs.io/
- **Custom API** - A centralized server that can serve arbitrary data

Let's walk through each of these options.

### On-chain

The metadata JSON files can be stored or generated as part of your smart
contract. In general, _storing_ data on the blockchain is very expensive, so
this approach isn't extremely common. However, for projects where the metadata
is relatively simple and can be _generated_ on-the-fly, e.g.
[Loot](https://www.lootproject.com/), then this approach is a great option.

The `tokenURI` function must return a valid uri that represents a JSON file;
after generating the metadata fields (title, image, attributes, etc), that data
must then be converted into a base64-encoded JSON file.

As an example, this is what it looks like when calling `tokenURI` for token 10
of the
[Loot smart contract on Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/address/0xff9c1b15b16263c61d017ee9f65c50e4ae0113d7#readContract).

![Calling tokenURI for Loot token 10](/docs/etherscan-loot-tokenuri.png)

Decoding this data gives:

<Editor
  height={140}
  filename="10.json"
  code={`{
  "name": "Bag #10", 
  "description": "Loot is randomized adventurer gear generated and stored on chain. Stats, images, and other functionality are intentionally omitted for others to interpret. Feel free to use Loot in any way you want.", 
  "image": "data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHByZXNlcnZlQXNwZWN0UmF0aW89InhNaW5ZTWluIG1lZXQiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAzNTAgMzUwIj48c3R5bGU+LmJhc2UgeyBmaWxsOiB3aGl0ZTsgZm9udC1mYW1pbHk6IHNlcmlmOyBmb250LXNpemU6IDE0cHg7IH08L3N0eWxlPjxyZWN0IHdpZHRoPSIxMDAlIiBoZWlnaHQ9IjEwMCUiIGZpbGw9ImJsYWNrIiAvPjx0ZXh0IHg9IjEwIiB5PSIyMCIgY2xhc3M9ImJhc2UiPk1hdWw8L3RleHQ+PHRleHQgeD0iMTAiIHk9IjQwIiBjbGFzcz0iYmFzZSI+Um9iZTwvdGV4dD48dGV4dCB4PSIxMCIgeT0iNjAiIGNsYXNzPSJiYXNlIj5EaXZpbmUgSG9vZDwvdGV4dD48dGV4dCB4PSIxMCIgeT0iODAiIGNsYXNzPSJiYXNlIj5TdHVkZGVkIExlYXRoZXIgQmVsdDwvdGV4dD48dGV4dCB4PSIxMCIgeT0iMTAwIiBjbGFzcz0iYmFzZSI+SG9seSBHcmVhdmVzPC90ZXh0Pjx0ZXh0IHg9IjEwIiB5PSIxMjAiIGNsYXNzPSJiYXNlIj5Xb29sIEdsb3ZlczwvdGV4dD48dGV4dCB4PSIxMCIgeT0iMTQwIiBjbGFzcz0iYmFzZSI+Ikhhdm9jIFN1biIgQW11bGV0IG9mIFJlZmxlY3Rpb248L3RleHQ+PHRleHQgeD0iMTAiIHk9IjE2MCIgY2xhc3M9ImJhc2UiPlBsYXRpbnVtIFJpbmc8L3RleHQ+PC9zdmc+"
}`}
/>

Note that the `image` uri is also encoded as a base64 SVG file. Even the image
is generated as part of the smart contract!

### IPFS

IPFS is a _decentralized_ storage protocol. It's conceptually similar to
consumer storage services like Dropbox or Google Drive, only instead of a single
company storing all of the files, _anybody_ can store the files. Storage
providers are incentivized to store files because they earn _filecoin_ for their
storage space.

There are a couple features that make IPFS well-suited for storing NFT-related
files, compared to e.g. Dropbox:

- **Immutable** - Files stored on IPFS _can't be changed_. An IPFS uri always
  refers to the exact same file data. Note that files _can_ potentially
  disappear if there are no providers storing them.
- **Permissionless** - Much like the blockchain, IPFS is a permissionless
  system: anybody can store files and communicate with other peers on the
  network, and no centralized authority can take files down. (NFT collectors
  don't have to worry about their NFTs being censored)

Additionally, IPFS introduces its own `ipfs://` uri scheme that's supported by
platforms like OpenSea.

As an example, let's consider Bored Ape Yacht Club again. Calling the `tokenURI`
function for token 10 returns an `ipfs://` uri:

![Calling tokenURI for BAYC token 10](/docs/etherscan-bayc-tokenuri.png)

If you put
[ipfs://QmeSjSinHpPnmXmspMjwiXyN6zS4E9zccariGR3jxcaWtq/10](ipfs://QmeSjSinHpPnmXmspMjwiXyN6zS4E9zccariGR3jxcaWtq/10)
in your browser address bar... probably nothing will happen. A few browsers,
like Brave, natively support IPFS and will show the file, but most won't.
However, the organization behind IPFS hosts a `https://` server for accessing
files from your browser, in this case:
https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmeSjSinHpPnmXmspMjwiXyN6zS4E9zccariGR3jxcaWtq/10

Once again we should see a familiar JSON format:

<Editor
  height={250}
  filename="10.json"
  code={`{
  "image": "ipfs://QmPQdVU1riwzijhCs1Lk6CHmDo4LpmwPPLuDauY3i8gSzL",
  "attributes": [
    { "trait_type": "Clothes", "value": "Navy Striped Tee" },
    { "trait_type": "Background", "value": "Aquamarine" },
    { "trait_type": "Hat", "value": "Bayc Hat Red" },
    { "trait_type": "Fur", "value": "Dmt" },
    { "trait_type": "Eyes", "value": "Eyepatch" },
    { "trait_type": "Mouth", "value": "Bored"},
  ] 
}
`}
/>

You'll also notice that this uri ends in the number "10". You can try changing
it to any other number 0 through 9999. In order to get the uris to start with
the same string, all 10000 metadata files are stored together on IPFS in a
single folder.

> For smaller NFT collections, it's also common to upload files individually and
> use a smart contract that supports setting a completely different uri for each
> token id.

> There's a great IPFS storage provider, https://nft.storage/, that's free for
> the foreseeable future (details on their site)

### Custom API

Lastly, you can set up a custom API that serves arbitrary JSON metadata. For
developers, this is likely the easiest option; for non-developers, IPFS may be
simpler.

The advantage of this approach is speed, cost, and flexibility. As an example,
`721.so` serves a simple set of NFT metadata for testing purposes. For _any_
token id from 0 to infinity, the API will return valid metadata. This would be
impossible with IPFS, since you could never upload _infinity files_.

For example, token 123456789,
[https://www.721.so/api/example/metadata/123456789](https://www.721.so/api/example/metadata/123456789):

<Editor
  height={240}
  filename="123456789.json"
  code={`{
  "name": "Token #123456789",
  "description": "An example nonfungible token. Photo by Ivan Slade from https://picsum.photos.",
  "image": "https://picsum.photos/id/941/510/510",
  "external_url": "https://unsplash.com/photos/RdyMe8KQAV0",
  "animation_url": "https://picsum.photos/id/941/2600/1734",
  "attributes": [
    { trait_type: "Width", value: 2600 },
    { trait_type: "Height", value: 1734 },
  ]
}`}
/>

## Choosing a Storage Option

The following table highlights a few key factors to consider when storing
metadata:

| Option     | Immutable | Permanent | Cost<div style={{ width: "80px" }}></div> | Flexibility |
| ---------- | --------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| On-chain   | âœ…        | âœ…        | ðŸ›‘                                        | ðŸ›‘          |
| IPFS       | âœ…        | ðŸ›‘        | âœ…                                        | ðŸ›‘          |
| Custom API | ðŸ›‘        | ðŸ›‘        | âœ…                                        | âœ…          |

Typically NFT collectors prefer "on-chain" metadata when possible. Data on the
blockchain is **immutable** (can't be changed) and **can never disappear**,
which is exactly what you want for most NFTs. However, this option only really
makes sense for certain kinds of very simple NFTs, where the `image` is embedded
into the metadata (e.g. Loot). The image in this case is almost always a small
SVG file, rather than PNG files, video files, or interactive multimedia, since
otherwise it would simply be too expensive.

Most projects store metadata files on IPFS. Data stored on IPFS is
**immutable**, but **can disappear**. Somebody has to pay a storage provider, or
run their own server, to keep the files available. Typically today the NFT
creator pays for IPFS storage, however conceptually it may make more sense for
the collector to pay for storage of the NFTs they buy.

Custom APIs are simple and inexpensive to set up as a developer. They're also
convenient because you can easily fix bugs that you may not encounter until
after the NFT sale begins. However, the downside for collectors is that the data
is **not immutable** and **can disappear** at any time. Many projects still use
custom APIs however, and ultimately it's up to the project and its collectors to
decide if the fact that data can change or disappear is important or not.

## Configurable Smart Contracts

Many NFT smart contracts allow configuring uris at the smart contract level, so
functionally the NFTs can still change or disappear even if they're stored using
an immutable storage system like IPFS.

This configuration feature is useful for a few reasons:

- There may be a bug in the metadata, and so it can be useful to be able to
  change it and fix things.
- You may want to do a "reveal", where people mint NFTs before the individual
  traits have been revealed. After all NFTs have been minted, you can change the
  uris to point to the _real_ metadata.
- You may actually _want_ to update the NFTs in the future, if that's a feature
  of your collection.

For example, Bored Ape Yacht Club and all Studio 721 contracts include the smart
contract function `setBaseURI`, which allows changing token uris.
