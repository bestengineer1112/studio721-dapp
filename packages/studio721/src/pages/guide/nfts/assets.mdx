Now that we've looked at how NFT smart contracts and metadata work, the last
piece is the `assets`. Where are the actual image, video, and other multimedia
files stored, and how are they connected to the metadata?

## Asset Storage

Much like metadata, assets can be stored on-chain (in a smart contract), on
decentralized storage (IPFS), or on centralized storage (a custom API, or other
hosting providers like AWS).

The main thing to consider is whether your assets are _static_ or _dynamically
generated based on user input or other factors_.

Most NFTs use static assets: images, video files, or webpages. Whether an NFT
collection has 3 video files or 3000 video files, IPFS is a great choice.

Some NFTs are created dynamically based on user input. For example, maybe the
collector can pick the color of an NFT when they mint it. In this case, there
are several options:

- If your assets are small files (SVG or tiny PNG), consider if you can generate
  them on-chain. Otherwise...
- Your assets can be an interactive webpage that you host on IPFS, and then you
  can customize the `tokenURI` function to add a query parameter
- You can upload a file to IPFS as part of your minting process (this is what
  https://ethblock.art/ does, for example)
- You can use a custom API that reads from your smart contract and returns an
  asset. This is a practical but not very "web3" solution.

If you're just getting started, uploading a folder to IPFS is probably the way
to go. After that, especially if you're a developer, the other options can be
fun to explore.

## Metadata

For an NFT that's just an image, you can use the `image` field of the metadata
JSON. If the NFT is any other kind of multimedia, e.g. audio, video, or webpage,
this should go in the `animation_url` field, as described in the
[OpenSea Metadata Standards](https://docs.opensea.io/docs/metadata-standards).
