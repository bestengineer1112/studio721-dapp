Studio 721 is a set of free, open source tools for creating NFT collections. The
Studio 721 tools are _composable_: you can use just one of them, or all of them
together! Feel free to use these tools any way you like!

Studio 721 currently supports deploying to Ethereum and Polygon.

## Walkthrough Video

If videos are your thing, I created this 4-part video series where I show how to
use each tool!

## All-in-one Workflow

The recommended all-in-one workflow is:

- Create or upload your assets using https://www.721.so/artkit, and publish to
  IPFS
- Create a custom smart contract using https://www.721.so/contract, and link
  your IPFS uri to your contract
- Configure a custom minting website using https://www.721.so/mint, and share it
  with collectors

**Up next, we'll review each tool!**
