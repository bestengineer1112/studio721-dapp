Welcome! In this guide we'll cover everything you need to know to start creating
NFTs.

Section 1 is a guide for learning how NFTs work, which covers smart contracts,
token metadata, and asset files.

In [Section 2](/guide/studio), we'll look at some of the tools you can use to
create these things. We'll primarily focus on the tools that are part of this
site, Studio 721. There's also a 4-part video walkthrough!

Studio 721 and this guide were created by me,

## Who is this guide for?

This guide is intended for people who are already familiar with cryptocurrency,
wallets, and _collecting_ NFTs. It will assume you're comfortable with e.g.
signing transactions using a wallet like MetaMask.

You'll also see developer terminology used throughout this guide, e.g. JSON.
While you don't need to be a professional developer to create NFTs, creating
NFTs is fundamentally somewhat technical, so it's valuable to familiarize
yourself with the terms if they're new to you.
