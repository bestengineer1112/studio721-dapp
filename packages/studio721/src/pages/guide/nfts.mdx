## Overview

Let's start by reviewing how NFTs, or _nonfungible tokens_, work.

Typically, there are 3 important components to any NFT:

- **Smart Contract** - How is the NFT stored on the blockchain?
- **Metadata** - Links to multimedia assets associated with this NFT, plus any
  attributes/traits.
- **Multimedia Assets** - The multimedia asset files (images, videos, etc)
  referenced by the NFT metadata.

Let's look at each of these in more detail.
